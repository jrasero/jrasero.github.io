	abstract = {A novel approach rooted on the notion of consensus clustering, a strategy developed for community detection in complex networks, is proposed to cope with the heterogeneity that characterizes connectivity matrices in health and disease. The method can be summarized as follows: (a) define, for each node, a distance matrix for the set of subjects by comparing the connectivity pattern of that node in all pairs of subjects; (b) cluster the distance matrix for each node; (c) build the consensus network from the corresponding partitions; and (d) extract groups of subjects by finding the communities of the consensus network thus obtained. Different from the previous implementations of consensus clustering, we thus propose to use the consensus strategy to combine the information arising from the connectivity patterns of each node. The proposed approach may be seen either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pretraining step to help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier. Applications on a toy model and two real datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which represents heterogeneity of a set of subjects in terms of a weighted network, the consensus matrix.},

              Genetic mutations of the Methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2) gene underlie Rett syndrome (RTT).

              mice and the glutamatergic/GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs) ratio is increased. Two weeks later, GABA exerts strong excitatory actions, the glutamatergic/GABAergic PSCs ratio is enhanced, hyper-synchronized activity is present and metabotropic long-term depression (LTD) is impacted. One day before delivery, maternal administration of the NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide restored these parameters but not respiratory or weight deficits, nor the onset of mortality. Results suggest that birth is a critical period in RTT with important alterations that can be attenuated by bumetanide raising the possibility of early treatment of the disorder.},

	abstract = {Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP) has been extensively reported as an inhibitor of key signaling pathways involved in the aggressive tumor phenotype and shows decreased expression in several types of cancers. However, little is known about RKIP in melanoma or regarding its function in normal cells. We examined the role of RKIP in both primary melanocytes and malignant melanoma cells and evaluated its diagnostic and prognostic value. IHC analysis revealed a significantly higher expression of RKIP in nevi compared with early-stage (stage I–II, AJCC 8th) melanoma biopsies. Proliferation, wound healing, and collagen-coated transwell assays uncovered the implication of RKIP on the motility but not on the proliferative capacity of melanoma cells as RKIP protein levels were inversely correlated with the migration capacity of both primary and metastatic melanoma cells but did not alter other parameters. As shown by RNA sequencing, endogenous RKIP knockdown in primary melanocytes triggered the deregulation of cellular differentiation-related processes, including genes (i.e., ZEB1, THY-1) closely related to the EMT. Interestingly, NANOG was identified as a putative transcriptional regulator of many of the deregulated genes, and RKIP was able to decrease the activation of the NANOG promoter. As a whole, our data support the utility of RKIP as a diagnostic marker for early-stage melanomas. In addition, these findings indicate its participation in the maintenance of a differentiated state of melanocytic cells by modulating genes intimately linked to the cellular motility and explain the progressive decrease of RKIP often described in tumors.},

            This study tested whether brain activity patterns evoked by affective stimuli relate to individual differences in an indicator of pre-clinical atherosclerosis: carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT). Adults (aged 30–54 years) completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks that involved viewing three sets of affective stimuli. Two sets included facial expressions of emotion, and one set included neutral and unpleasant images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Cross-validated, multivariate and machine learning models showed that individual differences in CA-IMT were partially predicted by brain activity patterns evoked by unpleasant IAPS images, even after accounting for age, sex and known cardiovascular disease risk factors. CA-IMT was also predicted by brain activity patterns evoked by angry and fearful faces from one of the two stimulus sets of facial expressions, but this predictive association did not persist after accounting for known cardiovascular risk factors. The reliability (internal consistency) of brain activity patterns evoked by affective stimuli may have constrained their prediction of CA-IMT. Distributed brain activity patterns could comprise affective neural correlates of pre-clinical atherosclerosis; however, the interpretation of such correlates may depend on their psychometric properties, as well as the influence of other cardiovascular risk factors and specific affective cues.},

	abstract = {Variation in cognitive ability arises from subtle differences in underlying neural architecture. Understanding and predicting individual variability in cognition from the differences in brain networks requires harnessing the unique variance captured by different neuroimaging modalities. Here we adopted a multi-level machine learning approach that combines diffusion, functional, and structural MRI data from the Human Connectome Project (N = 1050) to provide unitary prediction models of various cognitive abilities: global cognitive function, fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, impulsivity, spatial orientation, verbal episodic memory and sustained attention. Out-of-sample predictions of each cognitive score were first generated using a sparsity-constrained principal component regression on individual neuroimaging modalities. These individual predictions were then aggregated and submitted to a LASSO estimator that removed redundant variability across channels. This stacked prediction led to a significant improvement in accuracy, relative to the best single modality predictions (approximately 1\% to more than 3\% boost in variance explained), across a majority of the cognitive abilities tested. Further analysis found that diffusion and brain surface properties contribute the most to the predictive power. Our findings establish a lower bound to predict individual differences in cognition using multiple neuroimaging measures of brain architecture, both structural and functional, quantify the relative predictive power of the different imaging modalities, and reveal how each modality provides unique and complementary information about individual differences in cognitive function.},

              Acinetobacter baumannii
              in both structured and unstructured environments containing the antibiotic ciprofloxacin produced distinct genotypes and phenotypes, with lower resistance in biofilms as well as collateral sensitivity to β-lactam drugs (Santos-Lopez et al., 2019). Here we study how this prior history influences subsequent evolution in new β-lactam antibiotics. Selection was imposed by increasing concentrations of ceftazidime and imipenem and chance differences arose as random mutations among replicate populations. The effects of history were reduced by increasingly strong selection in new drugs, but not erased, at times revealing important contingencies. A history of selection in structured environments constrained resistance to new drugs and led to frequent loss of resistance to the initial drug by genetic reversions and not compensatory mutations. This research demonstrates that despite strong selective pressures of antibiotics leading to genetic parallelism, history can etch potential vulnerabilities to orthogonal drugs.},

The dataset also contains behavioral and emotional scores obtained with standardized questionnaires. To simulate personalized computational models of the brain, we also provide structural connectivity matrices, necessary to perform whole-brain modelling with tools such as The Virtual Brain. In addition, we provide blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging time series averaged across regions of interest for comparison with simulation results. An average resting state hemodynamic response function for each region of interest, as well as shape maps for each voxel, are also contributed.},

Integrated analysis of demographic data, images of the skin lesions, and serum and histopathological markers were analyzed in a group of 196 patients with melanoma. The interleukins (ILs) IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17A as well as IFNγ (interferon), GM-CSF (granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor), TGFβ (transforming growth factor), and the protein DCD (dermcidin) were quantified in the serum of melanoma patients at the time of diagnosis, and the expression of the RKIP, PIRIN, BCL2, BCL3, MITF, and ANXA5 proteins was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in melanoma biopsies. An AI algorithm was used to improve the early diagnosis of melanoma and to predict the risk of metastasis and of disease-free survival. Two models were obtained to predict metastasis (including “all patients” or only patients “at early stages of melanoma”), and a series of attributes were seen to predict the progression of metastasis: Breslow thickness, infiltrating BCL-2 expressing lymphocytes, and IL-4 and IL-6 serum levels. Importantly, a decrease in serum GM-CSF seems to be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with early-stage melanomas.},

              Originally considered to act as a transcriptional co-factor, Pirin has recently been reported to play a role in tumorigenesis and the malignant progression of many tumors. Here, we have analyzed the diagnostic and prognostic value of Pirin expression in the early stages of melanoma, and its role in the biology of melanocytic cells. Pirin expression was analyzed in a total of 314 melanoma biopsies, correlating this feature with the patient’s clinical course. Moreover,
              PIR
              downregulated primary melanocytes were analyzed by RNA sequencing, and the data obtained were validated in human melanoma cell lines overexpressing
              PIR
              by functional assays. The immunohistochemistry multivariate analysis revealed that early melanomas with stronger Pirin expression were more than twice as likely to develop metastases during the follow-up. Transcriptome analysis of
              PIR
              downregulated melanocytes showed a dampening of genes involved in the G1/S transition, cell proliferation, and cell migration. In addition, an in silico approach predicted that
              JARID1B
              as a potential transcriptional regulator that lies between
              PIR
              and its downstream modulated genes, which was corroborated by co-transfection experiments and functional analysis. Together, the data obtained indicated that Pirin could be a useful marker for the metastatic progression of melanoma and that it participates in the proliferation of melanoma cells by regulating the slow-cycling
              JARID1B
              gene.},
